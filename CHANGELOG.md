# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Added multi-evaluator run result semantics for Harbor verifier and platform
  LLM judge outputs while preserving the latest evaluator summary.
- Added a fixture-backed Harbor `jobs/` result ingestor that maps trajectories,
  verifier rewards, collected artifact manifests, and raw jobs archives into
  shared platform records.
- Added the first Harbor local Docker runner backend slice, including injectable
  `harbor run` execution, runner report artifacts, and worker attachment of
  ingested Harbor verifier results.
- Installed Harbor 0.9.0 in the dev image, aligned runner commands with the
  current `harbor run` CLI, and added a deploy-time real Harbor CLI local
  Docker smoke check.
- Fixed the generated Harbor CLI smoke task metadata so Harbor 0.9.0 recognizes
  it as a valid task instead of treating the path as an empty dataset.

## 0.0.0 - 2026-05-27

- Initialized private repository for agentic data generation and evaluation platform planning.
- Added project brief, GitHub templates, CI placeholder, and deployment placeholder.
