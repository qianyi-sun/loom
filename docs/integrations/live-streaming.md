# Live Trial Event Streaming

Loom exposes trial trajectory events through two paginated read
paths and one push-based Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream. Together
they cover pull-mode replay (dashboards, batch analytics) and live
observation (Trial Detail viewer, custom tooling).

All three endpoints require a bearer token with the `read:own` scope
and enforce the standard team-scoping rules: admins see every trial;
team tokens only see their own team's trials.

## Endpoints

### `GET /api/v1/trials/{trial_id}/events?after_seq=N&limit=M`

Seq-cursor paginated event replay. Reads from the Postgres
`trial_events` table with a MinIO trajectory-JSONL fallback for
trials that have no rows in `trial_events` but do have a stored trajectory.

| Query param  | Default | Meaning                                                      |
|--------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `after_seq`  | `-1`    | Return events with `seq > after_seq`. `-1` = from the start. |
| `limit`      | `200`   | Max events returned in this page. Cap: `1000`.               |

Response:
```json
{
  "events": [
    { "seq": 0, "kind": "trial_start", "trial_id": "…", "emitted_at": "…", "…": "…" },
    { "seq": 1, "kind": "step_start", "…": "…" }
  ],
  "next_after_seq": 1
}
```

- `next_after_seq` is the seq of the last event returned, or `null`
  if the page was empty (client should re-poll with the same cursor).
- The response shape is stable across the MinIO fallback path — the
  `payload` column already carries the full typed event body.

Use this endpoint for stateless polling, batch analytics, or as the
frontend's EventSource-unavailable fallback.

### `GET /api/v1/trials/{trial_id}/stream?after_seq=N`

SSE live stream. Emits an initial replay for events matching
`after_seq`, then streams new events as they land in the
`trial_events` table via a Postgres LISTEN connection on the
`trial_events_inserted` channel. The connection closes when the
trial reaches a terminal state OR the client disconnects OR the
connection has been open for 600 s (client reconnects with the last
seen seq).

The route sets `Cache-Control: no-cache` and `X-Accel-Buffering: no`
so proxies do not buffer chunks.

**SSE contract:**

| Event kind      | Emitted when                    | Data body                                        |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| _(default)_     | A new trajectory event arrives  | Full typed event body (same shape as `/events`). |
| `complete`      | Trial reaches terminal state    | `{ "final_state": "succeeded", "last_seq": N }`  |
| `reconnect`     | 600 s connection budget hit     | `{ "reason": "max_connection_sec", "last_seq": N }` |

Every message carries an `id: <seq>` line so browser EventSource
auto-reconnect includes `Last-Event-ID` on the next attempt. The
server does not currently consume that header; clients should also
dedupe by seq on their side (the SPA hook does).

Example (bash):

```bash
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOOM_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://loom.example.com/api/v1/trials/<trial-id>/stream"
```

### `GET /api/v1/trials/{trial_id}/trajectory?cursor=N&limit=M`

Compatibility pagination backed by the stored MinIO trajectory. Its line cursor
counts non-blank JSONL lines. Prefer `/events?after_seq=N` for seq-cursor
pagination.

## SPA integration

`web/src/hooks/useTrialEventStream.ts` wraps the browser
`EventSource` and exposes `{ events, status }`:

```tsx
const { events, status } = useTrialEventStream(trialId);
// status ∈ 'connecting' | 'open' | 'complete' | 'reconnect' | 'error'
```

The hook dedupes by event seq (browser auto-reconnect can replay
already-seen events) and closes the connection on unmount or on the
`complete` event. `TrialDetail` uses this hook by default and falls
back to `useAdaptivePolling` against `/trajectory?cursor=N` when
`status === 'error'` — appropriate for environments where corporate
proxies strip `text/event-stream`.

## Under the hood

Push semantics come from a Postgres trigger (`trial_events_notify_trigger`)
that fires `pg_notify('trial_events_inserted', '<trial_id>:<seq>')` on
every `trial_events` INSERT. The service opens one dedicated
`psycopg.AsyncConnection(autocommit=True)` LISTEN connection per SSE
stream; a per-request drain task filters notifications by the
`<trial_id>:` prefix and sets an `asyncio.Event` the outer loop
awaits with a fixed poll-interval fallback.

The MinIO trajectory JSONL is still written for every trial by the
worker (`TrajectoryWriter`); the `trial_events` table receives the
same events via the worker's `CpEventSink` batched dual-write. In
the current path MinIO is the archive/audit-log copy and the SSE reader is
Postgres-first.
