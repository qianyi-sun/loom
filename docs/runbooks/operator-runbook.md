# Loom operator runbook

This is the current operating reference for Nebius-hosted Loom
deployments. Component behavior belongs in the
[architecture documentation](../architecture/README.md); local-only setup is
covered by the [local development runbook](local-dev-workflow.md).

## Environment boundaries

Keep each environment's Kubernetes credentials, databases, object buckets,
SecretStore keys, worker tokens, provider connections, deploy credentials, and
GitHub Environment secrets separate.

| Environment | Source | Namespace | Public route | API base |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| development | `dev` | `loom-dev` | `https://yylx.world/dev` | `https://yylx.world/dev/api` |
| staging | pinned `dev` SHA | `loom-staging` | `https://yylx.world/staging` | `https://yylx.world/staging/api` |
| production | `main` | `loom-prod` | `https://yylx.world/prod` | `https://yylx.world/prod/api` |

Use the [native Nebius deployment procedure](../ops/nebius-deployment.md) with
reviewed environment JSON, signed candidate, runtime profile and trusted keyring.
The shared-cluster deployment workflow is retired. Automated hosted rollout is
unavailable until environment-specific native inputs and approval wiring are
reviewed; repository examples do not establish live staging or production identity.

Release promotion still requires candidate evidence and production approval.
Evidence may contain safe secret references, never credentials,
bearer tokens, signed URLs, object-store keys, or provider API keys.

## Locked operator environment

Use the repository lock and workspace packages for release commands:

```bash
uv sync --locked --all-packages --extra cluster --extra rollout --extra dev --python 3.11
uv pip check --python .venv/bin/python
```

The rollout extra installs the implementations under
`packages/loom-benchmarks` and `packages/loom-benchmark-terminal-bench-2`.
After syncing, use `uv run --no-sync` so an operational command cannot change
the environment implicitly.

## Hosted deployment

Nebius is the only supported hosted platform. Use the
[Nebius deployment procedure](../ops/nebius-deployment.md), including its exact
cluster identity, backup, migration, readiness and evidence checks. The
shared-cluster rollout broker and remote-worker deployment paths are retired.
`loom cluster up` accepts disposable development targets only.

Hosted desktop/GUI and Behavior GPU execution is unavailable. Several pipeline
classes still require Nebius conversion; see the
[retirement record](../historical/shared-cluster-retirement-2026-09.md).
Local execution remains available. A deployment smoke check does not prove
workload parity or full recovery acceptance.

## Workload trust boundary

Protected profiles accept only the current internal-trust tuple:

```toml
workload_trust_mode = "internal_trusted"
taskset_transforms_enabled = false
taskset_transform_network_isolated = false
untrusted_workload_isolation = false
```

Invalid profile, manifest, or live environment values fail before transform,
source, verifier, or subprocess content is fetched or run. The protected
namespace is authoritative target evidence, and manual rollout validates the
cluster and namespace identity before evidence collection or disposable local
work. `--skip-preflight` does not bypass the contract. See
[User-Brought TaskSets](../architecture/user-brought-tasksets.md) and
[Sandbox Isolation](../architecture/sandbox-isolation.md).

## Schema migrations

Run Alembic before rolling application pods. The standard deployment and
protected rollout paths do this automatically. For an authorized manual
cluster, render the sanctioned Job with the same image identity used by the
deployment:

```bash
uv run --no-sync loom cluster render-migration \
  --image-tag IMAGE_TAG \
  --namespace NAMESPACE \
  --container-registry REGISTRY > /tmp/loom-migration.yaml
kubectl apply -f /tmp/loom-migration.yaml
kubectl -n NAMESPACE wait --for=condition=complete job/LOOM_MIGRATION_JOB --timeout=10m
```

Inspect the failed Job and its logs before retrying. Database migrations are
forward-only during an image rollback; restoring an older schema requires the
separately approved backup-and-restore procedure.

## Backup and restore

Before a protected release, create database, object-store, and runtime-secret
backups using the environment's backup system. Then record a metadata-only
manifest and verify its completeness and age:

```text
loom cluster backup manifest --help
loom cluster backup check --help
```

Keep backup data and credentials outside repository Markdown, issues, pull
requests, and workflow logs. A restore must target the same environment
identity, start from an independently verified backup, pause new submissions,
restore database and object objects coherently, reapply runtime secrets, run
the current migration Job, and pass health plus representative trial checks
before traffic resumes.

### Service execution recovery and retention

The `0113` service-execution tables and `0114` immutable runtime contracts are
part of the ordinary PostgreSQL backup;
never export or restore them separately from `trials`, lifecycle authorities,
artifacts, and usage rows. Before a release or recovery, record counts grouped
by execution target, desired state, observed state, cleanup state, and command
state. Do not include trial or lease IDs in shared logs.

After restore and before resuming submissions:

1. migrate the restored database to the current schema and confirm it is at
   Alembic head;
2. keep every execution target disabled until its independent health probe is
   fresh;
3. compare each nonterminal lease with its command outbox and provider
   inventory by deterministic provider-scope, namespace, Job, and execution
   unit keys;
4. redeliver pending or expired command claims with their original
   idempotency keys; never synthesize a new lease or generation to hide an
   ambiguous provider action;
5. quarantine unknown provider objects and mark missing expected objects as a
   reconciliation error; do not adopt either by name;
6. require revoked generations to fail Gateway, heartbeat, artifact,
   trajectory, usage, and result writes before enabling any target.

For `0129` and later, also group `execution_leases` by
`materialization_state` and `source_cleanup_state`. A `pending` or expired
`running` materialization is self-healing: restore canonical PostgreSQL and
both object buckets, start the Control Plane with
`service_execution_materializer_enabled=true`, and let the original claim be
reclaimed. Do not reset attempts, synthesize a new upload session, copy an
object manually, or change a digest. A temporary failure retains its bounded
error and next-attempt time; an integrity failure becomes `unavailable` and the
Trial exposes `output_unavailable` for diagnosis.

`service_execution_materializer_concurrency` controls transfer concurrency per
Control Plane process (default eight). Change it through the deployment
configuration and normal rollout path; do not run ad hoc copier processes.

Canonical success requires all of the following together:

- `materialization_state=committed` and both canonical SHA-256 fields present;
- the Trial is terminal and its schema-1 trajectory index points at the
  configured trajectories bucket;
- the service-execution Artifact file list contains explicit canonical bucket,
  key, size, media type, and SHA-256 values;
- the normal authenticated Trial/Artifact endpoints download those exact
  bytes and the preserved commit evidence without an internal object-store URL;
- Batch Delivery Export contains the matching `trial_bundles/<task>/<trial>/`
  payload, `bundle.json`, root manifest, committed marker, and Artifact manifest,
  and rejects any size or digest drift during archive assembly.

After `service_execution_source_retention_sec`, the same worker claims source
cleanup. `retained` or expired `running` rows are retryable operational debt;
`complete` means every object named by the source root and item manifests has
been deleted. Never shorten the retention deadline by editing the row, and
never delete the source marker before canonical acknowledgement. Alert on the
materialization backlog/oldest-age gauges and retained source-spool bytes; an
increasing retry counter requires storage or database diagnosis, not a model
rerun. Nonzero permanent-unavailable count or bytes means corrupt source
evidence is being retained for diagnosis and must not be silently garbage
collected.

Retention runs only through the lifecycle GC inventory/approval path after
object deletion has been verified. Its metadata delete order is
`execution_leases` first (database cascades command, event, and history rows),
then resource usage, trial events, LLM calls, artifacts, Trials, and Batches.
Never delete command/event/history rows independently, and never downgrade
`0113` while any execution class, target, or lease exists. Never downgrade
`0114` while a runtime-bound or verifier lease exists, or `0129` while any
materialization has started. A failed provider
cleanup remains `pending`, `in_progress`, or `blocked`; it is operational debt,
not permission to purge its authority record.

#### Kubernetes execution actuator

The checked manifest at `deploy/k8s/nebius-execution-actuator.yaml` is the
accepted development runtime contract: one system-node replica, the canonical
development namespace/target, and an immutable Nebius registry digest. Apply it
only through `scripts/ops/apply_nebius_development_runtime.sh`; the script
validates the existing platform scheduler and Secrets, creates the collector's
non-expiring single-scope token only when absent, applies the recurring
collector, and waits for the first scheduled success. It never creates a Job,
Pod, or execution node for a user trial.

The initial bootstrap requires all of the following read back from its own APIs:

- the exact `execution_targets` row is enabled and fresh for this environment;
- the manifest namespace matches that target's immutable `namespace_name`;
- the pinned actuator image digest has release provenance and scan evidence;
- the referenced database Secret exists through the environment's secret
  authority, not through a checked-in Secret;
- the default managed runtime has passed a bounded non-root Pod smoke; no
  custom sandbox `RuntimeClass` is required;
- target capacity, NetworkPolicy, registry access, quotas, and cleanup alarms
  have passed their own gates.

Before a rollout, validate the real Kubernetes API seam locally without any
Nebius credentials or cloud calls:

```bash
LOOM_RUN_DISPOSABLE_K3S=1 \
  pytest -q tests/integration/test_execution_actuator_k3s.py
```

The test starts a disposable, digest-pinned k3s container and submits a
suspended Job. It verifies create/get/list/watch/exact-UID delete and destroys
the cluster on exit. Passing it proves API conformance only, not Nebius runtime
support or capacity.

For an authorized rollout, update the exact release digest in both Nebius
manifests, server-side dry run the complete render, and run the idempotent
bootstrap. Require `/readyz` to return 200; it remains 503 until both a database
command poll and a full Kubernetes reconciliation have succeeded recently.
Do not scale the development actuator above one replica without a measured
availability need.

Alert on sustained command age, cleanup debt, stale target health,
`loom_execution_actuator_kubernetes_api_errors_total`, watch restarts, nonzero orphan
count, or a zero reconciliation-converged gauge. Pending reason metrics are
bounded to normalized reasons and never contain lease, trial, Job, namespace,
or team labels. Interpret failures as follows:

- `unschedulable`, `image_pull_backoff`, `oom_killed`, `evicted`, `node_lost`,
  and `deadline_exceeded` are persisted observations; do not edit the Job to
  force success;
- create timeout or 409 must converge through exact identity readback;
- delete 404 is converged cleanup, but delete timeout is retried with the same
  UID precondition;
- UID/generation/target/unit mismatch is quarantined and dead-lettered; never
  delete or adopt it by name;
- an expired watch resourceVersion resets the watch cursor, while periodic
  full reconciliation remains the repair authority;
- a missing expected Job is recorded as failure, or as deleted only when the
  fenced desired state already requests cleanup.

To stop actuator effects during an incident, disable the execution target and
stop new reservations through the control-plane authority first. Allow current
command claims to acknowledge or expire, record pending cleanup debt, then
scale the actuator to zero through the protected deployment path. Scaling down
is cancellation of reconciliation, not rollback and not proof that Jobs were
deleted. Recovery uses the same database generations and command idempotency
keys; never bump a generation, clear an outbox row, or remove a finalizer to
hide ambiguity. Image rollback may run the previous compatible digest against
the forward schema; schema downgrade still requires all `0113`/`0114`
authority rows to be deliberately removed through the protected recovery
process.

## Production release

Production is promoted from a pinned `dev` candidate; it is not deployed from
an arbitrary branch or tag.

1. Choose the 40-character candidate SHA, built image tag or digest, and a new
   immutable SemVer `prod_tag` such as `v1.2.3`.
2. Deploy the exact candidate to Nebius staging through the Nebius deployment
   procedure and complete [staging validation](staging-launch.md).
3. Build the structured release manifest required by
   `scripts/ops/release_gate.py`, including image digests, frontend route
   evidence, `prod_staging_isolation`, `raw_delivery_export_status`, rollback
   and recovery data, and `release_owner_approval`.
4. Dispatch `.github/workflows/release-promotion-gate.yml` from `dev` while its
   current SHA exactly matches `candidate_sha`, with `image_tag` and the
   base64-encoded evidence manifest.
5. Open the same-repository `dev` to `main` promotion pull request. Let
   `.github/workflows/main-promotion-gate.yml` run from `dev` with the exact
   `candidate_sha`, PR number, and successful `release_gate_run_id`, then enable
   GitHub's native squash auto-merge. The composite gate verifies the PR and
   current `dev` head still match the release-gated SHA and evidence artifact.
   `main-promotion-gate` is the only merge authority for `main`.
   If `dev` advances, select and validate the new head rather than reusing stale
   evidence.
6. For `environment=production`, verify the same `candidate_sha` and `image_tag`
   with the successful `release_gate_run_id` using
   `scripts/ops/verify_production_release_gate.sh` from `main`. Retain Production
   Environment approval and reviewed native target evidence before following the
   Nebius deployment procedure. The retired workflow cannot deploy this release.
7. Put the recorded immutable `prod_tag` on the merged `main` commit. Never
   reuse or force-move a published production tag.

Manifest `release_owner_approval` records acceptance of the candidate and
evidence. Production Environment approval releases deployment secrets. They
are distinct controls and are not interchangeable with CI merge authority.

Rollback uses a previously recorded image digest or a merged revert promoted
through the same gate. Restore from the recorded recovery point if the new
schema or data is incompatible; do not force-move a tag.

## Storage retention

Review the configured lifecycle policy before applying it:

```bash
uv run --no-sync loom cluster bootstrap-storage-lifecycle \
  --config config/storage-lifecycle.example.toml \
  --dry-run
uv run --no-sync loom cluster bootstrap-storage-lifecycle \
  --config /secure/path/storage-lifecycle.toml \
  --endpoint https://OBJECT_STORE_ENDPOINT
```

The live apply path supports S3-compatible backends. Re-running the same policy
is idempotent. Confirm rules through the object-store API and monitor bucket
usage after changes. Pure GCS rendering is available in the renderer library
but is not dispatched by this CLI.

## Credential rotation

For worker tokens, overlap old and new credentials until every local development worker has re-registered with the new token:

```text
loom admin tokens worker rotate --help
loom admin tokens worker revoke --help
```

For provider connections, rotate and then validate the stored credential:

```bash
loom providers rotate-key CONNECTION --api-key env:PROVIDER_API_KEY
loom providers test CONNECTION
loom providers models CONNECTION --refresh
loom providers models CONNECTION --preflight MODEL
```

For the SecretStore master key, deploy the new primary alongside the old
fallback, run `loom admin secret-store rewrap`, verify all rows, restart
services with only the new key, and remove the fallback. Never remove the old
key before rewrap succeeds.

## Production alerts

The Prometheus rules in `deploy/k8s/prometheus-rules.yaml` are the source of
truth. Start with the firing rule, then correlate service health, pod restarts,
recent rollouts, queue/worker inventory, and dependency metrics.

| Area | Alerts | Immediate checks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| scheduling | `LoomNoWorkersActive`, `LoomQueueBacklog`, `LoomTrialsStuckClaimed`, `LoomWorkerReclaimsSpiking`, `LoomRetryExhaustedSpiking`, `LoomClaimLatencyP95High` | Worker inventory, claim latency, capacity limits, trial events |
| Control Plane | `LoomStatePatchTimeouts`, `LoomControlPlaneDown` | `/healthz`, pod logs, Postgres/PgBouncer, rollout state |
| Gateway | `LoomLLMGatewayDown`, `LoomGatewayProviderErrorRate`, `LoomGatewayCostSpike` | Gateway health, provider connection status, upstream errors and usage attribution |
| service/API | `LoomServiceDown`, `LoomServiceHighErrorRate`, `LoomServiceAuthFailureSpike`, `LoomServiceSubmissionRejectSpike` | `/api/v1/health`, ingress, auth audit events, rejection reasons |
| workers | `LoomWorkerProcessDown`, `LoomWorkerHeartbeatFailing`, `LoomWorkerTrialFailureRateHigh`, `LoomWorkerTokenStaleness` | Host/process health, heartbeat age, local Docker capacity, token generation |
| pooling/listen | `LoomPgbouncerClientWaiting`, `LoomPgbouncerScrapeDown`, `LoomListenWatcherPollFallback` | Pool saturation, exporter health, database reachability and LISTEN fallback |
| object storage | `LoomMinioPVCUsageHigh`, `LoomMinioPVCUsageCritical`, `LoomMinioWriteLatencyHigh`, `LoomMinioRequestErrorRateHigh`, `LoomMinioNodeOffline` | PVC and bucket usage, node/quorum state, write latency, lifecycle rules |
| Pipelines | `LoomPipelineStageQueueStuck`, `LoomPipelineStageDeadlineOverrun`, `LoomPipelineControllerReconcileErrors`, `LoomPipelineForcedCancellation`, `LoomPipelineCheckpointStale`, `LoomPipelineArtifactCommitFailures`, `LoomPipelineGpuAllocatedIdle` | Pipeline list/show/watch, Pipeline panels, scoped controller/worker logs, authority boundary |

Silence an alert only for a bounded maintenance window with an owner and
expiry. Record the sanitized incident timeline outside active reference docs.

### Worker-token staleness

Compare the active token prefixes reported by workers with the intended
generation. Install the new token on every consumer, restart one worker at a
time, confirm clean registration and claims, and only then revoke the old
prefix. An alert during an intentional overlap is expected; an old generation
after the overlap is not.

### MinIO PVC usage

Use `lifecycle-capacity inventory` above for shared staging; it measures the
least-free live MinIO drive on the distributed deployment and inventories the
exact managed buckets without granting write authority. For a single-node
custom cluster, confirm its host-path filesystem and bucket usage directly:

```bash
kubectl -n NAMESPACE exec statefulset/loom-minio -- df -h /data
mc du --recursive ALIAS/BUCKET
```

At the high threshold, identify growth and validate retention. At the critical
threshold, pause large submissions and protect write headroom. Never remove
objects directly unless their retention and trial/artifact references have
been verified.

### Pipeline Stage queue stuck

`loom_pipeline_stage_queue_age_seconds` means the maximum age by closed state and resource class. The alert requires ready/queued/retry_wait above 900 seconds or claimed above 300 seconds for 10 minutes. Use Grafana/Prometheus, `loom pipeline list`, `loom pipeline show RUN_ID`, and `loom pipeline watch RUN_ID`; then read only scoped logs with `kubectl -n NAMESPACE logs deploy/loom-control-plane --since=30m`. Cancel or retry only with submit authority; do not mutate database state or auto-remediate from the alert.

### Pipeline Stage deadline overrun

`loom_pipeline_stage_deadline_overrun_seconds` means time beyond the frozen Stage timeout plus 35-second cleanup grace. Any positive value for 5 minutes is critical. Correlate Grafana/Prometheus with `loom pipeline list/show/watch` and scoped `kubectl -n NAMESPACE logs -l app=loom-worker --since=30m`. Cancellation and worker remediation require the applicable operator authority; the alert grants none.

### Pipeline controller reconcile errors

`loom_pipeline_controller_reconcile_errors_total` counts exhausted operations, not successful transaction retries. Three increases in five minutes sustained for five minutes warn. Inspect its closed reason label, `loom pipeline list/show/watch`, and scoped controller logs. Do not bypass controller invariants, budgets, or durable leases; retry only through the authorized Pipeline API.

### Pipeline forced cancellation

`loom_pipeline_cancel_latency_seconds_count{outcome="forced"}` records positive forced-cleanup acknowledgement. Any increase over 15 minutes fires immediately. Inspect the run and Attempt lifecycle with `loom pipeline show/watch`, the cancellation Grafana panel, and scoped worker logs. Preserve committed Artifacts; follow worker cleanup authority before any remediation.

### Pipeline checkpoint stale

`loom_pipeline_checkpoint_oldest_age_seconds` is the age of the newest commit, or Attempt start before sequence zero, for active checkpoint-enabled Attempts. Above 300 seconds for 10 minutes warns. Use Grafana/Prometheus, `loom pipeline show/watch`, and scoped worker logs. Do not synthesize a checkpoint or enable checkpoint reuse; manual retry creates a full replay only when the API says eligible.

### Pipeline Artifact commit failures

`loom_pipeline_artifact_commit_failures_total` counts one returned operation failure by closed commit kind and reason. Any increase over 10 minutes sustained for five minutes warns. Inspect Grafana/Prometheus, `loom pipeline show/watch`, and scoped control-plane logs. Never retry individual multipart chunks manually, expose object keys, or weaken integrity/quota/fencing checks.

### Pipeline GPU allocated idle

`loom_pipeline_gpu_allocated_idle_seconds` measures a leased local GPU Attempt whose expected process group is absent or cleanup is pending; low utilization is intentionally excluded. More than 300 seconds for 10 minutes is critical. Inspect the reason series, `loom pipeline list/show/watch`, and local worker logs. Drain or cancel only under appropriate operational authority; do not kill an unidentified process from metric labels.

## Incident handoff

For any failed rollout or service incident:

1. Stop new mutations and preserve the current request, logs, and metrics.
2. Identify the environment, candidate/image identity, first failing check,
   affected teams, and whether durable state may be inconsistent.
3. Prefer read-only `status`, `reconcile --shadow`, health, and inventory
   commands before changing state.
4. Resume an immutable staging request only after its underlying failure is
   corrected; otherwise use a normal new rollout or release rollback.
5. Store redacted incident and release artifacts outside `docs/`; archive a
   stable retrospective only when it has lasting historical value.
