## Goal

Issue #51 establishes the first durable metadata layer for the backend service.
The platform keeps Python dataclasses as public domain contracts, while
repositories persist and hydrate those contracts from Postgres.

## Migration Tooling

The project uses Alembic with SQLAlchemy 2.x:

- Migration entrypoint: `python -m agentic_data_platform.persistence.migrations`
- Migration scripts: `src/agentic_data_platform/persistence/alembic/`
- Runtime driver: `psycopg`
- Local/CI repository tests: SQLite-backed migration smoke through the same
  Alembic command path
- Shared dev validation: `scripts/deploy-dev.sh` runs migrations against the
  Compose Postgres service before starting the API

`postgresql://` URLs are normalized to `postgresql+psycopg://` by the
persistence package so existing `.env` files do not need driver-specific URLs.

## Initial Tables

```mermaid
erDiagram
    teams ||--o{ users : has
    teams ||--o{ projects : owns
    projects ||--o{ runs : groups
    benchmark_suites ||--o{ benchmark_suite_versions : versions
    benchmark_suite_versions ||--o{ task_families : contains
    task_families ||--o{ task_instances : contains
    runs ||--o{ run_attempts : retries
    runs ||--o{ run_terminal_turns : records
    runs ||--o{ artifacts : emits
    runs ||--o{ evaluator_results : judges
    runs ||--o{ audit_events : logs
```

The initial schema covers:

- Identity and ownership: `users`, `teams`, `team_memberships`, `projects`
- Benchmark catalog metadata: `benchmark_suites`,
  `benchmark_suite_versions`, `task_families`, `task_instances`
- Run lifecycle metadata: `runs`, `run_attempts`, `run_terminal_turns`
- Outputs and evaluation: `artifacts`, `evaluator_results`, `skill_objects`
- Operations history: `audit_events`

Flexible benchmark, runner, model, evaluator, and artifact metadata is stored in
JSON columns for v0. Stable object-store URIs and keys are stored in Postgres;
large payloads such as full workspace archives remain object-store artifacts.

## Repository Boundary

Repositories take a SQLAlchemy `Session` and return domain dataclasses or small
read models:

- `IdentityRepository`: teams, users, and memberships
- `ProjectRepository`: project create/read/list/update
- `BenchmarkCatalogRepository`: fixture catalog upsert, suite-version listing,
  and task-instance detail/listing
- `RunRepository`: `RunRecord` save/list/get with terminal turns, artifacts, and
  latest evaluator result hydration
- `AuditEventRepository`: structured event recording for later PM/operator views

For v0, `RunRecord` has no public `attempt_id`, so `RunRepository.get_run()`
hydrates the latest internal attempt back into the existing dataclass shape.
Evaluator results are stored as many rows, while current callers receive the
latest result through `RunRecord.evaluator_result`.

## API Resource Boundary

Issue #52 connects these repositories to FastAPI resource endpoints through a
per-request SQLAlchemy session dependency. The first API routes expose teams,
projects, benchmark suite versions, task instances, run dashboard projections,
sanitized artifact references, and latest evaluator summaries.

The API intentionally keeps artifact payloads out of Postgres responses. It
returns stable metadata such as `artifact_id`, `media_type`, `size_bytes`, and
`storage_key`, while `RunDashboardProjection` suppresses local host paths and
signed URL query parameters.

Detailed endpoint notes live in
`docs/architecture/core-api-resources.md`.
