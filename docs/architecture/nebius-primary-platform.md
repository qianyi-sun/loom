# Nebius platform contract

Hosted Loom runs only on Nebius. Platform services, supported Kubernetes
execution, database, object storage, registry, backups and monitoring belong to
that platform. GitHub-hosted CI, image builds and publication remain supported,
as do local development and external user-selected inference APIs.

## Platform boundaries

System services and elastic execution pools have separate capacity policies.
Environment identities, database roles, storage scopes and credentials stay
separate. Public web/API access uses authenticated HTTPS; database and execution
management stay private. The [native execution contract](nebius-service-execution.md)
owns target placement, durable attempts, cancellation and fenced publication.

The primary region is `eu-north1`. Secondary-region routing remains disabled
pending separate qualification; checked-in regional support is not evidence
that a region is operationally accepted. Current deployment and recovery
procedures are indexed in [runbooks](../runbooks/README.md).

## Supported workload boundary

Native Kubernetes execution is the hosted path. OLDLAB, GB10, Slurm and remote
shared-cluster workers are retired, with no fallback route. Desktop/GUI and
Behavior GPU hosted workloads are unsupported. Other task and pipeline classes
require conversion according to the
[compatibility inventory](../evidence/service-workload-compatibility-v2.json).
Local execution and retained result access remain supported. Repository
retirement does not claim workload parity or implement those replacements.

Durable Trial/attempt identity, generation fencing, verifier rewards,
trajectories, artifacts, usage and provenance survive compute cleanup.
Kubernetes completion alone does not establish successful Loom finalization.
The [retirement record](../historical/shared-cluster-retirement-2026-09.md)
records the removed architecture and remaining compatibility obligations.

## Delivery and acceptance

Feature branches start from `dev`; `main` is reserved for release promotion.
[Contribution policy](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) owns required checks and merge
rules. [CI](../contributing/ci.md) describes validation selection;
[candidate publication](../runbooks/nebius-candidate.md) records commit identity
and immutable image references for deployment and rollback.

Source merge and credential-free CI do not establish live workload, recovery,
capacity or migration acceptance. Such evidence belongs to an exact candidate,
environment and explicitly authorized operation. No documentation cleanup
authorizes infrastructure shutdown, credential revocation or live data changes.
Workload qualification and operational acceptance remain tracked by #1550 and
#1538. Staging/production rollout automation still requires environment inputs
and approval wiring; see the retirement record for that boundary.

## Database lineage when moving from the isolated branch

The branches independently used revisions `0133`–`0135` for different changes.
`dev` keeps its published history through `0143`; the Nebius reward projection,
zero-quota observation and native-build observation migrations are appended as
`0144`, `0145` and `0146`. Fresh databases and existing `dev` databases upgrade
through that single chain. Nebius subsequently added native resource usage at `0136`;
`dev` preserves its published migrations through `0149` and appends native usage as `0150`.
The deployed Nebius series through `d07718e2` is retained by the conversion candidate.

An existing isolated-branch Nebius database at `0133`, `0134`, `0135` or `0136` is **not**
a database at the corresponding `dev` revision. Do not run this checkout's
normal upgrade against it or stamp it to a `dev` revision: that could skip
required schema changes. Moving an existing Nebius deployment requires
the [qualified lineage conversion](../runbooks/nebius-lineage-conversion.md), with
backup/restore evidence,
before selecting this `dev` candidate for deployment. Keep the previous
branch-bound candidate for that deployment until the conversion is qualified.

## Native task-image capacity fairness

Native build and trial admission share the existing capacity transaction lock,
placement model and provider quota identities. A lock alone does not prevent a
new trial from overtaking a builder whose capacity reservation was rejected.
The controller therefore retains one renewable waiting head per target in
`task_image_capacity_waits`, without consuming an attempt, retry budget, create
slot or cost reservation. Claim/render/admission run in a savepoint; a rejected
claim rolls back before the waiting record commits under the same outer lock.

A waiting record expires after 120 seconds unless a controller renews it after
validating actual demand and a realizable native shape. Cancellation, changed
materialization epoch, disabled target/policy and incompatible resource evidence
invalidate it. Compatible historical allocatable samples remain usable after
scale-to-zero. An impossible node/allowance combination cannot block other work.
An observed Ready node can also establish fit after its managed Pods drain,
without a compatible cold-node sample. Unknown foreign/DaemonSet resource and
slot occupancy remains charged; this does not establish cold-node capacity.
Changing a claim's epoch, target/pool or resource envelope loses its old waiting
priority and rejoins at the tail.

New admissions preserve waiting headroom in bin-packing, pending/create limits
and shared native quota accounting, including independent CPU pools sharing SSD
quota. Waiting itself is not an actual create or node-cost event. A builder
excludes its own head and respects older heads; already committed reservations
retain their precedence. Real reservations remain charged until UID-fenced
cleanup, even after cancellation or lease expiry. No running trial is preempted
and no machine is permanently reserved.

Fairness acceptance requires the matching controller and all capacity-admission
writers to be deployed. Mixed-version rollout and fixture tests alone do not
prove live no-overtaking behavior. This admission mechanism does not certify
Phase 2 rootless containment, signed publication or ARM support; those retain
their separate activation requirements.
