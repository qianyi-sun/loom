# Task image materialization

Hosted task-image builds run on Nebius through the execution actuator. The
control plane owns durable materialization identity and retry state; a
Kubernetes Job performs one build attempt. Local Docker image preparation is
part of the separate local-development path.

## Identity and admission

`loom.task_image_materialization` records content-addressed task inputs and
architecture-specific materializations. Task registration and submission ensure
required materializations exist. Frozen task configuration and bundle identity
prevent an update from changing an in-flight build.

`loom_execution_actuator.task_image_controller` reconciles native build Jobs
for an execution target. It uses the same capacity admission transaction lock
as native trials and records renewable waits when capacity is unavailable.
A waiting record is not a reservation or proof of executable capacity. See
[native capacity fairness](nebius-primary-platform.md#native-task-image-capacity-fairness).

The native renderer owns Job resources, source inputs, build configuration and
registry output identity. Supported architecture and workload requirements must
match the selected execution class; unsupported inputs must be rejected rather
than weakened to fit a build.

## Prepared service fixture components

A build records the primary image as `task` and each built sidecar as
`sidecar:<name>`. Resolution uses the exact component map and leaves prebuilt
components unchanged; it does not modify the frozen input configuration. A
prepared isolated fixture must itself be a built component, with a dedicated
build directory disjoint from the primary context. Its source directory and
Dockerfile never enter the agent input upload.

At execution reservation, the control plane locks the Trial-associated grant
and matches the fixture's image, role, hostname, command, resources and probes
against the frozen task. Missing, additional or substituted components fail
before attempt counts, leases or cost reservations change. A user-supplied UUID,
manual runtime template or digest is not image authority. Only these validated
fixture roles and prepared private task images are exempt from platform image
publication admission; the controller and runtime still require it.

See [isolated fixtures](nebius-service-execution.md) for the supported subset and
[execution security](nebius-execution-security.md) for mount and identity controls.

## Attempts, publication and cleanup

The materialization lease owns retries. Kubernetes Jobs do not independently
retry a build. Each durable attempt records resource observations and its Job
UID. Heartbeats and lease epochs fence state changes and completion so an old
process cannot publish readiness for a replacement attempt.

Readiness requires immutable image publication and the matching materialization
record. A configured tag or Kubernetes completion alone is insufficient. Native
execution admission consumes the resulting immutable task-image evidence.

Resource reservations remain charged until the controller confirms UID-fenced
cleanup. Cancellation, expiry and controller restarts must not authorize a new
attempt while an old resource may still exist. Publication evidence and retained
image references must remain readable for historical results and recovery.

## Compatibility and verification

Published migrations and historical materialization, publication and build-grant
records remain intact. The [shared-cluster retirement record](../historical/shared-cluster-retirement-2026-09.md)
explains removed providers and retained database lineage. Historical identifiers
do not make those providers eligible for new hosted execution.

Focused coverage includes `test_nebius_task_image_controller`,
`test_nebius_task_image_renderer`, native capacity integration and application
migration tests. The [service execution contract](nebius-service-execution.md)
and [platform contract](nebius-primary-platform.md) describe the surrounding
admission, artifact and recovery boundaries. Live workload acceptance remains
separate from repository checks.
