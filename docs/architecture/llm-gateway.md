# LLM Gateway

Service-mode-only FastAPI process that proxies all upstream LLM calls
so every trajectory carries faithful token usage + cost attribution
the host doesn't have to reconstruct.

CLI mode skips the Gateway entirely — `UpstreamDirectGatewayClient`
in `loom_cli/upstream_gateway.py` re-implements the same dispatch
contract against provider SDKs in-process. See [`cli-mode.md`](cli-mode.md).

## Responsibilities

1. **Multi-dialect routing** — accept the *same* logical request and
   forward via the right native dialect (`/v1/messages` for
   Anthropic, `/v1/chat/completions` + `/v1/responses` for OpenAI,
   `:generateContent` for Gemini). Other adapters (incl. LiteLLM)
   for tail providers go through `loom_llm_gateway.litellm_wrapper`.
2. **Token-usage extraction** — every dialect puts cache + reasoning
   counters in a different shape; `DialectAdapter` normalises them
   into a `TokenUsage` dataclass with a verbatim `provider_extras`
   dict.
3. **Cost attribution** — looks up the rate card for `(provider,
   model)` at request time, computes `cost_usd` from the extracted
   `TokenUsage`, writes a row to the `llm_calls` table with
   `(team_id, trial_id, step_id)` keys so any aggregation slices
   cleanly.
4. **Request-parameter audit** — stores a redacted normalized
   `request_params` JSON object with non-sensitive generation
   controls such as `temperature`, `top_p`, `seed`, max output limits,
   reasoning effort, tool-choice mode, and provider decoding extras.
   Prompt bodies, messages, headers, API keys, and raw credentials are
   omitted.
   Service-mode `TrialConfig.request_params` is the user-facing input
   for those controls on the `direct-completion` worker path; the worker filters
   that object through the same allowlist before forwarding it to the
   Gateway.
5. **Raw provider handoff logs** — provider-facade success paths also
   store a redacted raw request/response record under
   `llm_calls.provider_extras._loom_raw_provider_log` for production
   trajectory exports. Unlike `request_params`, this intentionally keeps
   prompt and assistant payloads for downstream training/audit bundles,
   but it redacts bearer values, provider API keys, secret-looking
   fields, and known secret text before persistence. The stable object
   ref is `llm_calls/<id>/provider_extras/_loom_raw_provider_log`.
6. **Bearer auth + per-team RPM** — every call carries a team
   token; the Gateway gates RPM per `(team, provider)` and rejects
   when over.
7. **License allowlists** — task-level allow/deny of model ids; the
   Gateway denies a request if its `model` field isn't in the team's
   allowlist.

## Endpoint shape (dialects)

| Route                    | Dialect             | Forwarded to                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| `POST /v1/messages`      | Anthropic native    | `anthropic.AsyncAnthropic.messages.create` |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat / BYO chat | Provider connection resolved from the authoritative step-JWT claim, with any header/body values required to match; `openai-compatible` / `custom` use `EgressClientPool`, while native Anthropic / Google connections use their LiteLLM transport |
| `POST /v1/responses`     | OpenAI Responses / BYO OpenAI-compatible Responses | Native OpenAI path or direct httpx through `EgressClientPool` when the step JWT or `x-loom-provider-connection-id` resolves to `openai-compatible` / `custom`; if a BYO endpoint exposes only Chat Completions and returns the chat-style "messages required" 400 from `/responses`, the provider facade retries once through `/chat/completions` and synthesizes a Responses body/SSE for Codex |
| `POST /v1/models/{model}:generateContent` | Gemini  | `google.generativeai.GenerativeModel.generate_content_async` |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` *(via litellm)* | Tail-provider shim | non-BYO and non-OpenAI-compatible fallback providers |
| `POST /openai/v1/chat/completions`, `/openai/v1/responses`, `/anthropic/v1/messages`, `/google/v1beta/...` | Sandbox provider facade | Direct httpx through `EgressClientPool` |

### Provider-connection authority

`POST /v1/chat/completions` resolves an optional provider connection across the
step JWT, `x-loom-provider-connection-id` header, and
`loom.provider_connection_id` body field. A provider claim in the verified
step JWT is authoritative. Every non-empty header or body value must match that
claim; a mismatch is rejected before provider lookup or upstream dispatch. For
legacy non-JWT callers, header and body are equivalent transports and must
match when both are present. When all three sources are empty, the request uses
the platform-credentialed path.

The family-run orchestrator does not choose a team by writing `loom.team_id`
and does not use its long-lived credential at the Gateway. For every
`skill_patcher_llm` call it presents its dedicated, teamless family-orchestrator
worker credential (scoped only to `family:evolve`) to Control Plane
`/admin/step-tokens`, explicitly supplies the
configured evolver provider (including null), and receives a short-lived
`llm:call` step JWT bound to the real completed trial, its represented team,
`step_id="family_evolver"`, and the authorized provider. The Control Plane
loads the trial team and repeats the provider owner/share check before minting
the JWT. The Gateway then authorizes provider lookup against the JWT team and
rejects caller-controlled attribution or routing that disagrees with it.

Provider API keys and secret references remain inside the SecretStore/provider
connection boundary. Family-run adapter parameters containing secret-like keys
fail closed before persistence, and Gateway failures must not log or echo
credentials, authorization values, secret references, or decryption exception
text.

The Gateway is **not** a single unified shape — each dialect's
response is forwarded verbatim. Agents see exactly the native
upstream shape, so client-side parsing stays standard. The
normalisation (TokenUsage → cost) happens *next to* the forward, not
*after* it.

Streaming is supported on the OpenAI Responses routes, the OpenAI Chat
provider facade, and on both Anthropic Messages routes. The Gateway accepts
`stream=true` on `/v1/messages`, `/v1/responses`, `/openai/v1/responses`,
`/openai/v1/chat/completions`, and `/anthropic/v1/messages`. Responses and
Anthropic routes forward native SSE streams and record usage from the terminal
usage-bearing SSE event. The OpenAI Chat provider facade preserves usage by
calling the upstream OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint with
`stream=false`, recording usage from the full JSON response, and returning a
synthetic OpenAI `chat.completion.chunk` SSE stream to streaming clients such
as opencode or aider. Other native routes (`/v1/chat/completions`) still reject
`stream=true` because their cost path expects the full JSON body.

For provider connections that are OpenAI-chat-compatible but not
Responses-compatible, the Responses facade has a narrow compatibility
fallback. It triggers only after an upstream `/responses` call returns
the chat-only missing-`messages` signature. The fallback converts the
Responses `instructions`/`input`/function-tool shape to a
non-streaming `/chat/completions` request, then converts the chat
message or tool calls back into Responses JSON or SSE. Unsupported
Responses-only item types are not treated as first-class ground truth;
operators should prefer a native `/responses` provider for production
score evidence when one is available.

```

Trial + step IDs ride as request headers (`X-Loom-Trial`,
`X-Loom-Step`) because the wire response is the unmodified upstream
shape — there's nowhere to inject them into the body without
breaking client parsing. Workers populate the headers from
`bind_trial_context` (see [`cli-mode.md`](cli-mode.md) for the
contextvars helper).

For `direct-completion` service-mode trials, callers may include
`trial_config.request_params` with safe generation controls, for
example:

```json
{
  "agent_name": "direct-completion",
  "agent_model": {"provider": "openai", "name": "gpt-4o-mini"},
  "request_params": {
    "temperature": 0,
    "top_p": 0.5,
    "seed": 1234,
    "extra_body": {"top_k": 40}
  }
}
```

The worker drops prompt/message payloads, headers, credentials, and
unknown provider fields before the request is sent. The Gateway then
records the effective non-sensitive controls in `llm_calls.request_params`
and the trial/batch debug evidence surfaces.

Provider-facade raw handoff logs are a separate export contract from
`request_params`. They live in `provider_extras` so the normal debug
surfaces can continue to show only safe generation controls, while
`loom eval batch delivery-bundle --mode raw-harbor` can package the
redacted full request/response bodies into `provider_logs/`.
Versioned training handoff profiles such as
`--mode raw-harbor-tb2-v1` reconstruct SFT rows from those provider logs
plus reward/metrics joins; the Loom event stream remains an audit spine rather
than the SFT source of truth for that profile. For `terminus-2` trials,
`--mode raw-harbor-tb2-v2` projects execution from typed `terminus2_*` events
and embeds hash-verified native Harbor checkpoint artifacts.
See [`terminus2-runtime.md`](terminus2-runtime.md).

Codex subprocess alignment runs use a separate adapter-specific path
because Codex constructs its own Responses request. The worker converts
sanitized per-trial `trial_config.request_params` into
`LOOM_CODEX_SETTINGS_JSON` for Codex subprocesses; deployment-level
`LOOM_CODEX_SETTINGS_JSON` remains only a fallback. The Codex launcher
sanitizes the JSON again and encodes it as
`model_providers.loom.query_params.loom_request_params`. The Responses
facade accepts that namespaced query param, sanitizes it again, merges
the safe controls into the upstream provider payload, and records the
same merged payload through the normal request-parameter audit.

## Central gateway boundary

Service-mode agents call providers through the Gateway rather than writing
provider usage directly to their trajectories. The boundary provides:

1. **Honesty** — agents are subprocesses that crash, misreport, or
   silently swallow errors. A Gateway-side count is observably
   correct even if the agent process disappears mid-call.
2. **Attribution** — `(team, trial, step)` cost slicing needs a
   *single* writer to the `llm_calls` table. With per-agent writes,
   teams have to trust every adapter to spell the keys right.
3. **Policy** — rate limits and per-team budget accounting need a chokepoint.
   Gateway is that chokepoint.

This adds one network hop and requires the service stack. CLI mode runs the
same `Trial.run()` without that stack and therefore has weaker centralized
attribution.

## What `litellm_wrapper` is for

LiteLLM provides a single `acompletion(model=..., ...)` call that
dispatches to ~100 providers. Loom uses it as the **tail-provider
adapter** — anything not covered by Anthropic / OpenAI Chat /
Responses / Gemini routes through LiteLLM. BYO OpenAI-compatible
connections are also excluded from LiteLLM on the service-mode gateway
path for both Chat Completions and Responses: the route owns that wire
shape and forwards with the pooled httpx client from `EgressClientPool`,
so Envoy sees the
`x-loom-connection-id` CONNECT header for the selected
`provider_connection_id`. The top-four providers and BYO
OpenAI-compatible dispatch bypass LiteLLM so:

- Native dialect responses are verbatim — LiteLLM's normalised
  response shape would obscure provider-specific fields.
- Token-usage extraction remains per-dialect, preserving fields such as
  `cache_creation_input_tokens` through the provider-specific path.
- LiteLLM does not provide a stable per-call hook for proxy CONNECT
  headers; the egress proxy's per-connection allowlist depends on that
  header.

## Failure modes + behavior

| Failure                                | Response                              |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Upstream timeout (>200s)               | 504, failed-attempt `llm_calls` row inserted with zero tokens and `provider_extras._loom_failure_category=upstream_timeout` |
| Upstream non-2xx                       | Forwarded or surfaced with a redacted excerpt; failed-attempt `llm_calls` row inserted with zero tokens and `provider_extras._loom_failure_category=upstream_http_4xx` or `upstream_http_5xx` |
| LiteLLM adapter exception or malformed upstream response | 502 with sanitized diagnostic text; failed-attempt `llm_calls` row inserted with `provider_extras._loom_failure_category=upstream_transport`; provider API keys and `Authorization: Bearer` values are redacted before logs or responses |
| BYO `/responses` endpoint is actually chat-only | One fallback POST to `/chat/completions`; success returns synthetic Responses JSON/SSE and records normal `openai_responses` usage from chat `usage` tokens |
| Rate-card missing                      | 422 `RateCardNotFoundError`; no row inserted |
| Bearer invalid / over RPM              | 401 / 429; no upstream call          |
| `stream=true`                          | Allowed for OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat provider-facade, and Anthropic provider-facade calls; other v1 dialect paths reject it where final usage cannot be attributed |
| Model not in team allowlist            | 403; no upstream call                 |

A failed call still produces an `llm_calls` row when the upstream
was contacted or the provider client attempted transport. The row
uses `input_tokens=0`, `output_tokens=0`, `cost_usd=0`, and
`rate_card_hash=failed-upstream`; `provider_extras` carries
`_loom_call_status=failed`, `_loom_failure_category`, and optional
status/error metadata. Failed rows also carry
`_loom_usage_status=missing` because no successful provider usage block
was observed. This makes debug evidence distinguish "no request
attempted" from "request attempted and failed upstream" while keeping
prompt bodies, messages, headers, bearer tokens, API keys, and
credentials out of persistence. Pre-upstream failures (auth, rate-card,
license) leave no row. Subprocess agents may surface some transport drops only
as stderr text after the SDK exits; the worker classifies those terminal
messages as `provider_transport_disconnect`, applies the trial retry policy,
and exposes that distinct reason in debug evidence instead of grouping them
with generic `internal_error` or agent logic failures.

## Persistence schema

`llm_calls` columns of note:

| Column           | Notes                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `team_id`        | from bearer token                                        |
| `trial_id`       | from `X-Loom-Trial`                                      |
| `step_id`        | from `X-Loom-Step`                                       |
| `dialect`        | route/dialect label such as `openai_chat`, `openai_responses`, `anthropic`, or `gemini` |
| `model`          | exact model id the request used                          |
| `input_tokens`   | from DialectAdapter                                      |
| `output_tokens`  | from DialectAdapter                                      |
| `provider_extras`| JSONB — cache + reasoning counters verbatim on success; `_loom_call_status=failed` plus failure metadata on failed upstream attempts |
| `request_params` | JSONB — redacted normalized generation controls; `NULL` means the data is unavailable |
| `cost_usd`       | computed at insert; cached for usage metrics/audits     |
| `rate_card_hash` | rate-card table hash or sentinel such as `failed-upstream` |
| `attempt`        | gateway-internal attempt number that produced the success or final failed response |

The frozen `cost_usd` column is a fast index for `/api/v1/usage` and
Gateway cost metrics; trial and batch detail responses expose token
totals, call counts, request-parameter summaries, and failed-call
status counts for local debugging.
