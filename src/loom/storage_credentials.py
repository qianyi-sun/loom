"""Object-store credentials provider.

A single ``build_s3_client`` factory that honors the ``auth_kind``
discriminator from ``config/loom-schema.toml`` (#250). Every component
that holds an S3 client constructs it through this module — that way
the IRSA path (or eventually Workload Identity, Vault dynamic
credentials, etc.) lights up automatically across the service,
control plane, worker, and CLI without per-call-site changes.

Design
------

The factory takes individual parameters rather than a settings object
because:

- ``LoomServiceSettings``, ``ControlPlaneSettings``, ``WorkerSettings``
  are codegen-produced and structurally similar but not interchangeable
  (different class identities). A Protocol would force every caller
  to import that Protocol; the function signature does the same job
  with less ceremony.
- The CLI public-beta-catalog caller doesn't have a Settings object at
  all; it builds the client from CLI arguments.

Caller pattern:

.. code:: python

    from loom.storage_credentials import build_s3_client

    client = build_s3_client(
        endpoint_url=settings.minio_endpoint,
        auth_kind=settings.storage_auth_kind,
        access_key=settings.minio_access_key.get_secret_value(),
        secret_key=settings.minio_secret_key.get_secret_value(),
        region=settings.minio_region,
    )

For ``auth_kind="irsa"``, ``access_key`` and ``secret_key`` are
ignored — boto3 walks its standard provider chain.
