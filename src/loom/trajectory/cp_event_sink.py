"""CP-side event observer that batches typed trajectory events and
POSTs them through to the `trial_events` table via the worker's
`HttpControlPlaneClient.append_events` method (#5 Slice 3b).

Owned by the worker for the lifetime of one trial. The worker
constructs it once per trial, wires it as `TrialContext.event_observer`,
and `TrajectoryWriter` calls `observe(event)` from `append`
alongside the existing local-JSONL + MinIO multipart writes. On
trial close, `flush_and_close()` drains the buffer.

MinIO remains the authoritative copy until #5 Slice 3c flips the
SSE reader from MinIO-poll to Postgres-LISTEN. So in this slice
the sink is best-effort — any POST failure is logged and the
batch is dropped, never fails the writer. Slice 3c may tighten
the error path; that's a separate decision.
