"""Workspace materialization — upload the task bundle into the sandbox.

The worker materializes `bundle["source"]` into a host-side `task_dir`
that contains everything the bundle ships: `instruction.md`,
`solution/`, `tests/`, `task.toml`, etc. Before #186 the trial loop
left that directory on the host — only the OracleAgent uploaded its
own `solve.sh`, and the verifier path was effectively dead for any
benchmark whose grading tests live in the bundle (HumanEval,
SWE-Bench).

This module ports the `docker cp task_dir → /workspace` step that
`loom_benchmark_tool.oracle_runner` has used for the verify CLI into
the production trial path, using the Driver protocol's single-file
`upload()` (no Protocol change needed).
