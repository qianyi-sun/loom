"""Trajectory paginated read + authenticated download (spec §5.2) +
seq-cursor event replay + SSE live stream (#5 Slices 1 + 3c + 3e).

The legacy events.jsonl object lives in the same `trajectories`
bucket the worker's TrajectoryWriter writes to, at the key
`<team_id>/<trial_id>/events.jsonl`. Slice 1's first cut of
`/trials/{id}/events?after_seq=N` + `/trials/{id}/stream` read
events from there.

#5 Slice 3c flipped event reads to the Postgres `trial_events` table
(populated by Slice 3a's CP endpoint via Slice 3b's worker
dual-write). MinIO remains the audit-log copy and the first download
source for legacy object-backed trials; when that object is absent,
the download endpoint reconstructs JSONL from `trial_events`.

#5 Slice 3e replaces the SSE inner poll loop with a psycopg LISTEN
consumer that waits on the `trial_events_inserted` channel (added
by migration 0041). Events become push-bound: when a worker insert
commits, the trigger NOTIFYs, the consumer wakes, and a focused
incremental read ships the new rows. The fixed `poll_interval`
fallback still ticks every ~1.5s as a safety valve for missed
notifications + terminal-state detection (state transitions don't
trigger NOTIFY). On LISTEN connection error the route degrades to
pure-poll mode — no UX regression vs. Slice 3c.

MinIO fallback: a trial whose worker shipped before Slice 3b will
have 0 rows in `trial_events` but a populated MinIO trajectory. To
preserve UX for those trials, the route falls back to MinIO when
Postgres returns no rows AND the trial state suggests events
should exist. The fallback is removed in a future cleanup pass
once 3b has been deployed long enough to cover all observable
trials.
