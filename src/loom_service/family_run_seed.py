"""Service-side helper: seed family-run state on batch accept (#672 PR-3).

Called from ``loom_service.routes.batches._create_batch_record`` when
either the trial_config or the benchmark catalog opts a batch into
family-run mode. Responsibilities:

1. Resolve the effective ``ResolvedFamilyRunSpec`` from the catalog
   default + trial_config override.
2. Materialise per-family state (empty tarball) via the configured
   ``state_backend`` plugin.
3. Insert ``batch_family_state`` rows with the ordered task sequences.
4. Return a ``task_id -> family_key`` mapping so the fanout path can
   stamp ``trials.family_key`` when it submits each trial to the CP.

Kept as a standalone module so the batches route stays testable at
the shape level: a fake ``state_backend`` covers the wire path
without standing up MinIO, and the resolver / seeder in
``loom.family_run`` cover the plugin dispatch on their own.
