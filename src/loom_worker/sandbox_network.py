"""Per-trial sandbox bridge management (#78 Phase A).

Each trial gets its own `--internal` docker network so the sandbox
container has no host route. The per-node `loom-llm-gateway-sandbox`
singleton (Phase B) joins each bridge to mediate model traffic; until
that lands, this module is callable but unwired from Trial.run().

Subnet allocation: pull a free `/24` from `10.42.{1..254}.0/24` per
worker. Allocator state is worker-local; multiple workers on the same
host SHOULD partition the pool (env-configurable second octet planned
in Phase B) to avoid CIDR collisions across worker processes.

Shells out to the `docker` CLI rather than the docker-py SDK because:
1. `docker network create --internal` is one positional flag we don't
   want to misroute through the SDK's network-driver kwargs;
2. tests can inject a fake `docker_runner` and verify exact argv;
3. the singleton (Phase B) will use `docker events`, also CLI-only.
