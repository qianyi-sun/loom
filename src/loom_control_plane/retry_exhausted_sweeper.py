"""Background sweep that transitions queued trials to failed when they have
exhausted their retry budget (spec §2.8).

A trial's retry budget is exhausted when
`attempt_count >= team_quotas.max_attempts_ceiling` — the admin's per-team
ceiling. The claim SQL already filters these out (workers will never receive them), but
nothing was transitioning them to a terminal state — they sat in `queued`
forever, keeping their parent batch in `running` forever.

This sweeper closes that gap: on each tick it atomically sets
`state='failed', failure_reason='retry_exhausted', finished_at=NOW()` for
all such trials, then increments the `loom_retry_exhausted_total` counter so
dashboards can see the rate.

A LIMIT cap of 100 per tick prevents table-lock pile-ups on pathological
deployments; the next tick picks up any remainder.

Model after `scheduler/crash_detector.py` — same loop shape, same error
handling, same cancellation contract.
