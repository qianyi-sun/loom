"""Per-connection httpx client pool for the egress-proxy chain (#190 PR-C2).

When `LOOM_GW_EGRESS_PROXY_URL` is set, every upstream HTTP call
from this gateway must route through the Envoy egress proxy on that
URL AND carry `x-loom-connection-id: <connection_id>` on the
proxy request. HTTPS upstreams carry it on the CONNECT request; HTTP
upstreams carry it on the forward-proxy request, and Envoy strips it
before forwarding upstream.

httpx exposes proxy-header injection via `httpx.Proxy(headers=...)`,
which is per-Proxy = per-client. So we maintain a small pool keyed on
`connection_id`, lazily building a client per connection and reusing it
for all of that connection's requests. The pool is bounded by the
number of `provider_connections` rows (≤ team count × per-team
connections, currently <1k in practice), so no LRU eviction is needed.

When the env var is empty (default), `get_egress_client_for` falls
through to the shared `upstream_client` and no per-connection
clients are built. Lets operators flip the proxy off via env without
a code change.
