"""Prometheus metrics for the LLM Gateway (#81 slice B-2).

Cardinality is bounded by design:
- `provider` is a fixed set (openai, anthropic, google, openai-compatible,
  custom — 5 values).
- `dialect` is a fixed set (openai, anthropic, google, responses,
  gemini — 5 values).
- `result` is a small enum per metric.
- `team_id` is high-cardinality — we attach it ONLY where the
  per-team breakdown is critical (`COST_TOTAL`), never on rates or
  latencies.

Naming: `loom_gateway_*` prefix keeps gateway series distinguishable
from CP / service / worker series in shared dashboards.
