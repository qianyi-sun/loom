"""Snapshot → Envoy CDS+RDS protobuf (#190 PR-C1b).

Pure function over the format-agnostic `Snapshot` shipped in PR-C1a
(#192). Produces:

- One Envoy `Cluster` per ConnectionAllowlist, with the allowlisted
  IPs as static endpoints. Cluster name: `egress-<connection_id>`.
- A single `RouteConfiguration` with one Route per ConnectionAllowlist.
  Each route matches on BOTH the `x-loom-connection-id` header AND
  the `:authority` upstream target (`<upstream_host>:<port>`) — this
  layered match defeats the CDN-IP-collapse problem the spike (#196)
  surfaced: a Cloudflare IP serves thousands of domains via SNI, so
  IP-only enforcement is insufficient.

Why pure (no gRPC/server state): the xds_server holds a
SnapshotCache that maps `Snapshot.version` → these protobuf objects.
Each on_snapshot push from the watcher rebuilds via this function;
the cache then sends DiscoveryResponses to any subscribed Envoy.
