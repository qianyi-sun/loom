# Note: a "probe raises through pgbouncer" negative test used to live here but
# was removed because probe detection depends on the pool state (backend
# rotation happens only when there's contention). At low concurrency the same
# backend is reused across SET/commit/SHOW inside one client TCP connection, so
# the probe appears to pass. The real failure mode the probe defends against
# (session state not persisting when new connections are drawn from the pool)
# is exercised by `test_application_name_does_not_persist_across_new_connections_through_pgbouncer`
# above.
