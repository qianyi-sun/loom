"""Integration tests for the LISTEN watcher self-test probe (#609).

Verifies that notify_round_trip:
  - Returns True on a direct Postgres connection (same-connection LISTEN/NOTIFY works).
  - Returns False when LISTEN is registered on connection A but NOTIFY arrives from
    connection B routed through pgbouncer transaction mode — demonstrating the real
    production failure that the self-test is designed to detect.
