"""Integration test for 0073 — the renumbered-lineage reconciliation (#949).

Simulates a pre-#857 staging database: it carries the full staging-lifecycle
content but is MISSING the three inserted migrations' content (0062 benchmark
profiles, 0066 autoscaler prod-pressure, 0067 gb10 pool rename) and is stamped
at 0072. Proves that stamping such a DB to 0072 and running ``upgrade head``
(which includes 0073) heals it into the exact fresh-head shape, and that a
second run is a guarded no-op.
