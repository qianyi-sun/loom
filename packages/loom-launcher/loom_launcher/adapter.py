"""AgentAdapter Protocol + supporting types.

These types duplicate shapes from `loom.driver.base` and `loom.models.types`
on purpose: this package is distributed for installation inside
sandbox containers, where importing the full `loom` library would pull in
unrelated server-side dependencies (sqlalchemy, fastapi, alembic).
`loom_worker.SubprocessAgent._bridge()` adapts between the two surfaces.
