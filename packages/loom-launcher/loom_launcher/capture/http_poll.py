"""poll_local_http — fetch events from an HTTP endpoint inside the sandbox.

This helper supports adapters whose agent runs a local server inside the
sandbox. The worker cannot reach the container's loopback directly, so the
helper executes `curl` inside the sandbox and parses the output. No included
adapter currently selects this capture path.

**Sandbox requirement.** The sandbox image MUST have `curl` installed
on PATH. Any adapter using this capture mechanism MUST document the dependency
in its Dockerfile and adapter docstring. If curl is missing, `exec_oneshot`
returns rc=127 and the polling loop emits zero events (logged at
DEBUG, not an exception — silent failure is better than crashing the
trial for what is fundamentally an image-build issue).
