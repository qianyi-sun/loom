# Nebius execution-target infrastructure

This directory owns one Terraform state for the shared Loom Nebius execution
cluster. It creates networking, registry, evidence storage, IAM identities, one
Managed Kubernetes control plane, a fixed system node group, and an autoscaled
execution node group. Development, staging, and production remain distinct
logical target bindings inside that cluster.

It does **not** authorize cloud creation, quota changes, billing, credentials,
production deployment, Kubernetes workload bootstrap, or Loom traffic. A web
console login is not a Nebius CLI profile. Before every plan or apply, follow
the authorization and cost gate in
[`docs/runbooks/nebius-infrastructure.md`](../../../docs/runbooks/nebius-infrastructure.md).

The capacity observer service account, tenant read-only permit, and authorized
public key are part of this state. The public key omits `expires_at`; its private
credential is supplied only to the Kubernetes runtime Secret and is never
committed or printed. Nebius SDK access tokens remain short-lived and refresh
automatically from that stable key, so a human CLI/browser login is not a
runtime dependency. Infrastructure convergence likewise uses a dedicated
non-expiring service-account profile for the Nebius provider and a separate
non-expiring Object Storage key held in macOS Keychain for the S3 backend.

## Layout

- `modules/execution-target`: reusable, version-pinned target resources.
- `stack`: the only root module operators plan and apply.
- `targets`: the sole shared-cluster example. Its development-named anchor is
  retained deliberately so the existing live state converges instead of
  creating replacement infrastructure.
- `backends`: the existing development remote-state anchor with a native lock
  file. The state bucket is an independently authorized prerequisite.

The cluster example is checked against the three environment bindings in
`config/service-execution-topology.json`. Each binding has a distinct namespace,
target ID, health identity, and evidence prefix, while all three bind the same
physical cluster scope, region, and failure domain. A second cluster, state, or
region requires a separately accepted requirement and owner decision.

## Version and offline validation

The contract pins Terraform `1.16.0` and `nebius/nebius` `0.6.46`. Provider
locks contain both `darwin_arm64` and `linux_amd64` checksums.

```bash
python3 scripts/check_nebius_iac.py
terraform fmt -check -recursive deploy/terraform/nebius
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/nebius/modules/execution-target init -backend=false
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/nebius/modules/execution-target test
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/nebius/stack init -backend=false
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/nebius/stack validate
```

These checks exercise repository structure and mocked Terraform plans only.
Validate the root `stack`, not the reusable child module in isolation: the
root supplies the child module's `nebius.no_default_labels` provider alias.
They do not prove Nebius credentials, quota, capacity, price, creation,
convergence, Kubernetes access, pod execution, autoscaling, isolation, disaster
recovery, or destruction.

Provider `0.6.46` exposes Managed Kubernetes audit logging but no native
monitoring, alert, dashboard, or budget resources. This stack enables audit
logs and exports stable target/cluster/node-group identities for #1552's
collector and accounting work. Account-level budget enforcement is separately
configurable; cluster health must never be treated as cost or alert evidence.

## Optional staging source spool

The existing shared state can additionally own one dedicated staging source
bucket, without another cluster, state, or VM. It is disabled by default:
omitting `staging_spool` leaves all five spool resources absent and preserves
the original resources and credentials. To opt in, add this non-secret input to
the protected variable file after selecting a globally unique unused name:

```json
"staging_spool": { "bucket_name": "loom-eu-north1-example-staging-spool" }
```

An opt-in plan adds exactly a bucket, service account, group, membership, and
access key. Never import/reuse an existing state or evidence bucket/key as this
spool. The variable rejects evidence-bucket equality and non-spool names; the
operator must also compare the selected name with the actual backend bucket
because Terraform does not expose backend configuration to module variables.

The dedicated group receives only `storage.object-editor` through that bucket's
policy: object read/write/list, multipart create/complete/abort, and deletes for
acknowledged materialization GC. It receives no project/tenant permit, anonymous
access, bucket administration, or policy-edit permission. Completed objects have
no expiry; only unfinished multipart uploads are aborted after seven days.
Versioning is disabled so application GC removes bytes rather than accumulating
old versions. No new size/budget limit is imposed; account quota still applies.
The canonical staging PostgreSQL and MinIO remain authoritative destinations.

The key omits `expires_at` and explicitly uses `EXPLICIT` delivery. The existing
automation service-account profile obtains refreshed API tokens; no personal
browser session or runtime STS-refresh support is required. The sensitive root
output `staging_spool` contains endpoint, region, bucket and service-account IDs,
`access_key_resource_id`, `aws_access_key_id`, and delivery mode, **not secret
bytes**. A protected bootstrap consumer captures the result of
`nebius iam v2 access-key get-secret --id <access_key_resource_id>` using the
automation profile, checks the returned top-level `aws_access_key_id` against
the protected output, and installs the top-level `secret` into the canonical
staging source Secret. Neither response nor raw Terraform output belongs in
terminal logs or review evidence. The persisted key can be fetched again after
provider refresh/import; creation does not depend on a one-time INLINE result.
Use the supported Secret reconciliation/rollout path when deliberately rotating
credentials; non-expiring does not mean irrevocable.

The native endpoint is `https://storage.<region>.nebius.cloud`; ordinary system
CA verification remains enabled. Tests prove plan shape, policy boundaries,
omitted expiration, and output references, not live S3 authorization. Activation
still requires the reviewed exact plan and a real small-object, multipart,
readback, canonical materialization, and post-acknowledgment GC smoke.

Provider/API contracts: [access-key resource at the pinned provider version](https://github.com/nebius/terraform-provider-nebius/blob/v0.6.46/docs/resources/iam_v2_access_key.md),
[non-expiring service-account access keys and native endpoints](https://docs.nebius.com/iam/service-accounts/access-keys),
[Object Storage action/role matrix](https://docs.nebius.com/object-storage/supported-actions),
and [bucket-scoped policies](https://docs.nebius.com/object-storage/buckets/bucket-policy).

## Plan shape

The deployment gateway now has a separately reserved private `/32` allocation
attached through the mutable `network_interfaces[].aliases` field. The
replacement-only primary `ip_address` and fixed public allocation are unchanged.
The output retains `deployment_access.private_address` for its original DHCP
meaning; private service consumers must instead use
`private_service_allocation` and `private_service_cidr`. The latter survives
a VM replacement while the allocation is retained.

Fresh stacks wait for Kubernetes to reserve its Service CIDR first. A
postcondition requires the resulting service alias to be a `/32` in the node
network; if this check fails, the allocation may already exist, but attachment
is blocked. Investigate and clean up only that exact new allocation.

An existing-stack plan should add this one allocation and update only the
gateway in place, with no VM/disk replacement. Cloud assignment does not prove
the guest owns the address: the scoped gateway proxy installer in the
[runbook](../../../docs/runbooks/nebius-infrastructure.md) persistently configures
the approved alias without changing DHCP/default routes. Neither planning nor
this output activates the staging link or provisions application credentials.

After the runbook gates are satisfied, prepare the one shared state anchor:

```bash
cp deploy/terraform/nebius/targets/development-eu-north1.tfvars.json.example /secure/path/development-eu-north1.tfvars.json
cp deploy/terraform/nebius/backends/development-eu-north1.s3.tfbackend.example /secure/path/development-eu-north1.s3.tfbackend
scripts/ops/with_nebius_terraform_state_credentials.sh terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/nebius/stack init -reconfigure -backend-config=/secure/path/development-eu-north1.s3.tfbackend
scripts/ops/with_nebius_terraform_state_credentials.sh terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/nebius/stack plan -var-file=/secure/path/development-eu-north1.tfvars.json -out=/secure/path/development-eu-north1.tfplan
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/nebius/stack show -json /secure/path/development-eu-north1.tfplan > /secure/path/development-eu-north1.plan.json
```

Never commit populated variables, backend credentials, kubeconfigs, plan
files, state, tokens, or private keys. The populated variable file includes the
non-secret public half of the capacity-observer key; keep it alongside the
other protected exact-target inputs. Apply only the reviewed saved plan and
only after the owner has approved its exact target, resources, maximum hourly
and monthly cost, cleanup deadline, and residual-cost list.

## Optional public Service allocations

The cluster subnet denies public allocations by default. A public Kubernetes
Service LoadBalancer needs its fixed allocation's pool to be available in that
subnet. Once the existing network has the selected public pool attached, set
`enable_public_service_allocations = true` in the protected foundation stack
variables to let the subnet inherit those pools. This changes allocation
eligibility for resources in the shared subnet; it does not automatically
assign public addresses. Both system and execution node interfaces continue to
omit `public_ip_address`.

For the existing integration platform, inspect the foundation plan with this
single opt-in: the expected infrastructure change is the existing target subnet
`ipv4_public_pools.use_network_pools` from false to true, with no creates,
deletes, allocation/IP replacement, network change or node-group update.
Use the original foundation backend and variables, not the independent platform
state. Review all other drift separately and obtain approval for this shared
subnet update before applying; do not hide it behind an allocation replacement
or a guessed LoadBalancer annotation.

See [Nebius LoadBalancer configuration](https://docs.nebius.com/kubernetes/clusters/load-balancer)
and the [subnet resource schema](https://docs.nebius.com/terraform-provider/reference/resources/vpc_v1_subnet).
